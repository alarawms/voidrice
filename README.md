KISS autoricer "*made by me, for me*"

## Void Linux

Void Linux is a really lightweight desktop oriented Linux which is not necessarily that good for beginners if you go the minimalistic route but easier if youre installing a DE flavour.

Void Linux has runit as an init system and uses LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL, it has an extremely fast package manager and quite some packages too.

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple but its strictly for the XBPS package manager (Void Linux Only) just run the following command:

`bash install`

This install is meant for fresh installations of Void Linux and may overwrite your previous files.

I hold no responsibility over anything that gets broken during the install. If any bug was found please create an issue and I'll get to it when I can.

## DWM

DWM is great customizable Window Manager for Xorg and has needs a bit of time to learn how to configure(in my opinion, less than others).

DWM patches used in this build: actualfullscreen, alttagsdecoration, attachaside, pertag, selfrestart, uselessgap, xrdb
