# Automatic Void Ricer

![Rice](https://github.com/dconixDev/voidrice/blob/main/config/.otherfiles/Rice.png?raw=true)

TL;DR KISS autoricer "*made by me, for me*"

## Void Linux

Void Linux is a really stable and lightweight desktop oriented Linux Distro, great for beginners and "elitists" alike.

Void Linux has the option of using musl C standard library instead of glibc, has runit as an init system and uses LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL, it has an extremely fast package manager and quite some packages too.

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple but its strictly for the XBPS package manager (Void Linux Only) just run the following command:

`bash install`

This install is meant for fresh installations of Void Linux and may overwrite your previous files.

***Disclaimer*** I hold no responsibility over anything that gets broken during the install. If any bug was found please create an issue and I'll get to it when I can.

## DWM

DWM a is great customizable Window Manager for Xorg and requires a bit of time to learn how to configure(in my opinion, less than others).

DWM patches used in this build: *actualfullscreen, alttagsdecoration, attachbottom, bottomstack, center, fixborders, movestack, pertag, uselessgap, xrdb*

ST patches used in this build: *alpha, clipboard, font2, scrollback*
